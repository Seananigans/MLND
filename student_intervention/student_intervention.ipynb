      "-\tGeneral Application:\n",
      "    *\t Classification. AdaBoost is a boosting algorithm that uses \u2018weak learners\u2019 (other machine learning algorithms that will perform even slightly better than random classification) to classify data.\n",
      "    *\tIt works by creating a new vector/column with equal weights for every training example and normalizing the weights. Then it iteratively classifies the data in the training set using the weak learner, determines which examples it got wrong, gives those examples higher weights, and finally renormalizes the weights so that they sum to one. This process will continue until the specified number of estimators has been reached, or classification error has reached zero.\n",
      "-\tWhat are its strengths and weaknesses?\t\n",
      "    *\tStrengths:\n",
      "        *\tPerforms well.\n",
      "        *\tIn this circumstance of using decision trees, we can stave off overfitting by using a shallower depth than would be used for a single decision tree.\n",
      "        *\t AdaBoost generally works well on both training and test sets.\n",
      "        *\t It is widely held as one of the top performing meta-algorithms in machine learning.\n",
      "    *\tWeaknesses:\n",

      "                *\tDecision Tree O(n*depth) \n",
      "        *\tLearns slowly.\n",

      "        *\tIt can overfit data if the data is not \u2018well-behaved\u2019 aka if it is uniformly random. \n",
      "        *\tBoosting algorithms normally have a lot of parameters to tune in order to get the best model.\n",
      "-\tGiven what you know about the data so far, why did you choose this model to apply?\n",

      "- Based on the experiments you performed earlier, in 1-2 paragraphs explain to the board of supervisors what single model you chose as the best model. Which model is generally the most appropriate based on the available data, limited resources, cost, and performance?\n",
      "    * Given that for each model the training and predicting times are exceedingly low, combined with the fact that you would not need to run this model dynamically, multiple times a day or week, it is most appropriate to go with the model that has the best F1 score. The best performing algorithm here is the Support Vector Classifier, and it is the algorithm I have chosen to tune for the final model. However, if you intended to run this model more dynamically, it performs almost the same on 200 observations as it does on 300 observations when considering the F<sub>1</sub> score.\n",
      "\n",
      "- In 1-2 paragraphs explain to the board of supervisors in layman's terms how the final model chosen is supposed to work (for example if you chose a Decision Tree or Support Vector Machine, how does it make a prediction).\n",
      "    * The goal of the SVM is to find a hyperplane that separates and is farthest away from the opposing classes. Simplu put, if two classes in two dimensions are able to be divided by drawing a line between them, then a SVM will find that line. However, what makes this line special is that the line maximizes the normal distance between itself and any of the points. In addition, if the classes cannot be separated by a line because of exceptional observations, the SVM will allow these cases and still find a line that best separates most of the classes. In this scenario, we must remember that the algorithm is subject to the quality of our data and will try to find the most robust hyperplane that will work to separate most of the data.\n",
      "    * If the boundary that separates the data is non-linear, meaning in cannot be separated by simply drawing a line or inserting a flat plane between the two classes, then an SVM can use a kernel function to transform the data into new features that are able to be well-separated by a line.\n",
